# Advice for the project
The past few months we have worked on the project you gave us. We have some tips if you want to continue the project.
* Simplify database interaction: Instead of using complex queries, we recommend to use an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. This will make it easier to handle database operations and simplify your code.

* Leverage Chart.js: We highly recommend using Chart.js for your data visualization. It offers a wide range of options to enhance your charts and graphs, allowing you to present data in a visually appealing manner.

* Make options draggable: To provide a more interactive experience, consider implementing draggable options within your charts. This will allow users to customize their view and enhance their overall engagement.

* Grid display for additional widgets: If you plan to make more widgets in the future, we would advise to display them in a grid layout. This will help maintain a clean and organized interface, making it easier for users to navigate and understand the available options.

* Utilize Vue.js and components: We suggest using Vue.js as your JavaScript framework, as it offers excellent support for creating reusable components. This modular approach will simplify development, enhance code maintainability, and improve overall efficiency.

* Cache data for performance optimization: Implementing caching mechanisms can significantly improve your website's performance. By storing frequently accessed data in a cache, you can reduce the need for repeated database queries, resulting in faster response times for your users.

* Handle missing field scenarios: Based on a usability test, we observed that an API call was made without filling out a field, leading to no data being returned. To mitigate this issue, we recommend implementing proper validation checks before making API calls. Ensure that all required fields are filled out before proceeding with the request, preventing such scenarios and providing a more robust user experience.

We hope you find these suggestions helpful as you continue working on your project.
