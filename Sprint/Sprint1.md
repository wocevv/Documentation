We decided to try a new Retrospective which we made ourselves: the Clash Royale retrospective. On the left side you can see the positive things in green and on the right side you see the negative things in red. The opponent (upper half) and us (lower half) both have towers. The closer the text is to a tower, the bigger the issue or the better the succes is.
