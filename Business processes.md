# Business Processes

### Target Audience

Our application caters to companies seeking effective data visualization solutions. World of Content has entrusted us with this project to develop software for their customers.

### Impact on Customers

Our application specializes in visualizing large volumes of data, providing companies with a comprehensive overview and insights into their data and associated information.

### Mindset

While considering this project a test, it is crucial to view World of Content as our valued stakeholders, and our goal should be to deliver a functional product that meets their requirements. Instead of treating it as a mere test application, we aim to deliver a Proof of Concept (P.O.C.).

## Requirements & Design

To kickstart our web application project for World of Content, we engaged in detailed stakeholder discussions to gather essential project information. Based on these insights, we crafted user stories and identified key tasks critical to achieving the desired outcome. Additionally, we created a design prototype that showcases the intended look and feel of our web page. You can find further details [here](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/Design.md).

## Agile Method

To ensure efficient project management and collaboration, we have adopted the Agile methodology, specifically leveraging the Scrum framework. This approach enables us to break down the project into manageable sprints, prioritize tasks, and maintain regular communication. By incorporating feedback and responding to evolving requirements, we ensure a flexible and responsive development process.

## Documentation

Thorough documentation plays a vital role in maintaining clarity and transparency throughout the project. Our chosen central repository, GitHub, serves as a comprehensive documentation hub. It encompasses various components, including a C4 module, our definition of done, detailed design specifications, an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) model, ethical considerations within our team, relevant research materials, and comprehensive API and code documentation. All documentation files can be found in the "documentation" folder, where this file is also located.

## Testing

To ensure a high-quality and reliable web application, we have implemented rigorous testing measures. Unit tests are employed to validate the functionality and integrity of our application, while usability tests are conducted to evaluate its user-friendliness. Further information regarding our usability tests can be accessed [here](https://github.com/wocevv/Documentation/blob/main/usability-test.md).
