# C4 Model
We have made the c4 model as we expect the system to look when it is finished.
## Context diagram
Down here we have made a context diagram. It represents the system as a box surrounded by the user and other systems that interact with it. The context diagram contains a front/back-end and an external service Auth0. With Auth0 you can create an account and login, we also want to secure our api with it.

## Container diagram
Down here we have made the container diagram. It represents the individual service. It looks a lot like the context diagram only with a database added.
