# Ethics

we have used the acm code of ethics to analyse the cultural differences and ethics in our project. The numbers in front of the text wil refer to the acm code of ethics document.


1.1
Our project is a data visualisation program. 
This program ensures that employees dont have to manually do this task. 
This will save a lot of time that can cost a lot of money.

1.2
By automating the data visuaization people wont have to continuesly stare at data for hours on end which could cause a lot of mental strain.

Manually visualizing data can cause allot of mental and fisical strain. By creating our project we hope to lighten this strain.

1.5
While making the program we have given credits to all the sourced we got code from. Copyright microsoft.

1.6 
All data used in our program is private to the person that it belongs to or is important to.

2.1
We try to integrate our stakeholder feedback as well as possible so the final product is as close to the result as they possibly wanted.

2.2
Our group strives to be as profesional and honest with each other as we can while still being friendly.

2.6
As a group school project witht the time we had this was a bit much. The project needed more time then we could give it.

2.7
Since our project is open source everybody can see what we do and how we do it. We offer a description of how to use it and what it is for.

3.2
Within our group we all have the same amount of 'power'. Every sprint we have a different scrum master and this person has the final say when things are unclear.

3.6
We also communicate with all the changes we make so that it wont cause errors. Like deleting branches or editing interfaces.

4.1 If someone wants to change the interfaces or delete a branch this first gets communicated with the team so no relevant code or documents get lost.

 # business plan

This is done by application that lest you create widgets with the data u wanna visualise for example the time the products in albert Heijn were last updated. To make it really easy to manage the data u can create a dashboard with all different kind of widgets to your personal needs. So in summary our application will make it much easier to manage and visualise alot of data.
