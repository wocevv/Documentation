# Ethics

we have used the acm code of ethics to analyse the cultural differences and ethics in our project. The numbers in front of the text wil refer to the acm code of ethics document. [acm code of ethics](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics)


1.1
Our project is a data visualisation program. 
This program ensures that employees dont have to manually do this task. 
This will save a lot of time that can cost a lot of money.

1.2
By automating the data visuaization people wont have to continuesly stare at data for hours on end which could cause a lot of mental strain.

Manually visualizing data can cause allot of mental and fisical strain. By creating our project we hope to lighten this strain.

1.5
While making the program we have given credits to all the sourced we got code from. Copyright microsoft.

1.6 
All data used in our program is private to the person that it belongs to or is important to.

2.1
We try to integrate our stakeholder feedback as well as possible so the final product is as close to the result as they possibly wanted.

2.2
Our group strives to be as profesional and honest with each other as we can while still being friendly.

2.6
As a group school project witht the time we had this was a bit much. The project needed more time then we could give it.

2.7
Since our project is open source everybody can see what we do and how we do it. We offer a description of how to use it and what it is for.

3.2
Within our group we all have the same amount of 'power'. Every sprint we have a different scrum master and this person has the final say when things are unclear.

3.6
We also communicate with all the changes we make so that it wont cause errors. Like deleting branches or editing interfaces.

4.1 If someone wants to change the interfaces or delete a branch this first gets communicated with the team so no relevant code or documents get lost.


# Quick scan of tict

- Human Values: 
  - It creates an easier way for companies to manage and visualise their data.

- Transparency: 
  - there are a lot of documents written for the user so everyone can understand and use the software. For example, there is an introduction with an explanation what the software is and why it is written. Also, there is a user friendly front-end which makes it easy to navigate in.

- Impact on Society: 
  - The problem our software solves is the visualisation of data for companies. Instead of a lot of employees that need to check data and keep checking it you can make a dashboard with graphs that can visualise it a lot faster and easier.

- Stakeholders: 
  - This software is primarily written for companies with a lot of data.

- Sustainability:
  -  We implement features that allow users to efficiently manage and analyse their data, reducing the need for excessive processing and energy use. We have also created a user-friendly front-end which helps customers efficiently visualise data, this makes the time and energy required for the data exploration faster.
- Hateful and criminal actors: 
- Data: 
  - We have looked into the data and checked if any was incomplete or empty. When one is empty or incomplete like every item was added at the same day this has been communicated to the stakeholders.

- Future: 
  - This software can serve unlimited amounts of people if the database has the room for it. In the future we can make a specialised configuration for companies, so it takes less time and energy for companies to have a dashboard.

- Privacy: 
  - We have a lot of data that is personal it registers companies and brands data which is private. You also need to have an account to make use of the software, so we have to store your personal data.
- Inclusivity:
  -  there is no bias in the data since it is about products there is no discussion about the values of the data. There is an bias in the front-end design since we personally think its user-friendly and we have only done 3 usability tests with people from one location so there is no diversity in the tests.
