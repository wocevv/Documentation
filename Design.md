# Design

## Low-res
Before we started working on the UI/UX design we should have made a low-res design. We could have communicated this design with WoC before creating it. After we had a prototype for our website we created the Low-Res design and send this to WoC. They gave us some feedback which we used when creating the actual website.

## High-res
In addition to the low-res design, we also made a High-Res design. Here we converted our Low-Res design to a High-Res design. We focussed more on the details such as colours, button sizes and positioning. The High-Res design was also created for the final design. The High-Res has boxes that you can slide in the position where you want them. However, currently the actual application uses dropdown boxes for starters.
