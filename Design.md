# Design

## Low-res
We have made a low-res design so we can because then we can easily talk about whether we have everything on the website and that the site is user-friendly and not that a button has the right color.

## High-res
In addition to the low-res design, we also made a high-res design. Here we converted our low-res design to a high-res design where we looked more that it looks nice.
